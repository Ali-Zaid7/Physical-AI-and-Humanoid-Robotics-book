# Chapter 00.4: Course Overview and Learning Outcomes

This book is structured as a hands-on guide to building and programming a humanoid robot from the ground up. Each module will build upon the last, taking you from foundational concepts to a fully integrated Physical AI system.

### Course Structure

*   **Module 00: Introduction – Foundations of Physical AI** (You are here)
    *   *Goal*: Establish the core concepts of Physical AI and the structure of this course.

*   **Module 01: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**
    *   *Goal*: Build the software backbone that allows all parts of the robot to communicate.

*   **Module 02: Digital Twin Simulation**
    *   *Goal*: Create a physically accurate virtual environment for safe robot development and testing.

*   **Module 03: The AI Robot Brain (Perception & Navigation)**
    *   *Goal*: Give the robot the ability to "see" and understand its environment, and to navigate autonomously within it.

*   **Module 04: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**
    *   *Goal*: Integrate a large language model to enable the robot to understand and execute natural language commands.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon completing this course, you will be able to:

1.  **Design and Architect Robot Software**: Understand and implement the core components of a modern robotics software stack using ROS 2.
2.  **Leverage Simulation for Robotics**: Create and use digital twins for efficient and safe robot training and testing.
3.  **Implement AI for Perception**: Integrate advanced AI models for tasks like object detection, localization, and mapping (SLAM).
4.  **Build End-to-End Navigation Systems**: Implement a full navigation stack (Nav2) to enable autonomous robot mobility.
5.  **Create Cognitive AI Systems**: Build a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) pipeline that grounds a large language model in the physical world, enabling natural human-robot interaction.

By the end of this journey, you will have the foundational knowledge and practical skills to design, build, and program the next generation of intelligent humanoid robots.
