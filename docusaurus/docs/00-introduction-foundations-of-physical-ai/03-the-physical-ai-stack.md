# Chapter 00.3: The Physical AI Stack

Building a humanoid robot is a multidisciplinary challenge that requires orchestrating a complex "stack" of technologies. This isn't just about programming; it's about integrating hardware, low-level control, real-time sensing, AI perception, cognitive reasoning, and human-robot interaction.

This chapter introduces the layered architecture—the **Physical AI Stack**—that powers modern humanoid robots. We will provide a high-level overview of the key components you'll encounter throughout this book:

*   **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**: The communication backbone that connects all software components, enabling real-time data exchange.
*   **Digital Twin Simulation**: The virtual sandbox where robots are designed, tested, and trained safely and efficiently before deployment to hardware.
*   **AI Robot Brain (Perception & Navigation)**: The intelligence layer responsible for understanding the environment, localizing the robot within it, and planning its movements.
*   **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: The cognitive framework that allows robots to understand human commands, reason about tasks, and execute complex actions in the physical world.

Understanding this stack is crucial for grasping how a humanoid robot transforms raw sensor data and abstract commands into purposeful physical actions, laying the foundation for our deep dive into each module.
