## Response snapshot

I have created the new "Module 00: Introduction – Foundations of Physical AI", including four new chapters and the necessary sidebar configuration. The new content is now integrated into the Docusaurus site.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a new introductory module with four chapters for the Docusaurus book.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: Created 5 new files (4 content chapters, 1 sidebar category configuration).
- 🔁 Next prompts: User to review the newly generated content.
- 🧠 Reflection: The autogenerated sidebar in Docusaurus can be customized with a _category_.json file, which is a cleaner approach than manually managing the entire sidebars.ts file.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The initial attempt to run the bash script for PHR creation failed due to the Windows environment, requiring a manual fallback.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
