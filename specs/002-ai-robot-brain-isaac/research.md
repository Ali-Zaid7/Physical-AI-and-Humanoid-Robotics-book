**Date**: 2025-12-30

This document consolidates research and key technical decisions for this module.

## Research Summary

No specific research was required for this module as the core technologies (NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Nav2, Docusaurus) are well-defined industry standards for robotics AI and documentation. The `spec.md` provided sufficient detail for the conceptual nature of this educational module. The plan relies on established best practices for these technologies.
